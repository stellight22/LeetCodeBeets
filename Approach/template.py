#Name of Question

#Approach
'''
This is a brute force method to go through the entire list of integers from 
beginning to the end 
x starts at the beginning and y is the number that is one after
the inner loop y will run for every value in first iteration
y is always after x, so there is no need to go back to a value once x moves
-because we have already compared every possible combination with the value
